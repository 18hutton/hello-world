# hello-world
My first GitHub repository

Hey there Github!

New resident of Manhattan, obsessed with all things digital. I've been diving into web dev for the last few weeks, so it only makes sense to start using Git. Hopefully I'll catch on pretty fast. The end goal is to develop slick websites from the ground up... it's gonna take a while.
